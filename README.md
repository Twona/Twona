- 👋 Hi, I’m @Twona
- 👀 I’m interested in furthering my python and python repositories.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning so much. Networking, netadmin, programming, and some personal projects to advance different non-tech skills.
- 💞️ No colaborations at the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me, you can't! Buwahahahaha!

<!---
Twona/Twona is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
